# SoftwareList

This is a software listing and updating assistant for Windows, which aims at two goals:
1. Generate a HTML-based list of all installed Win32 applications on your computer, which helps to you install them on a new computer.
2. Check update for applications in your self configured "update list".

This project is currently under construction. It runs on Python 3, and you will need to install `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
